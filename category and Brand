ROW_NUMBER requires an ORDER BY clause syntactically. 
You cannot use it without one. 
SELECT NULL is a hack to shut up the error while not enforcing any particular order. 
In this case we don't need to enforce any order, so the fastest option is to use SELECT NULL.

drop table input

CREATE TABLE input (
    category VARCHAR(50),
    brand_name VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO input (category, brand_name) VALUES
('chocolates', '5-star'),
(NULL, 'dairymilk'),
(NULL, 'perk'),
(NULL, 'eclair'),
('Biscuits', 'Britania'),
(NULL, 'goodday'),
(NULL, 'boost');

select * from input order by (select null)

with cte as (
select *, ROW_NUMBER() over (order by (select null)) as rnum
from input),

cte2 as (
select *,  count(category) over (order by rnum) as cnt from cte
)
select FIRST_VALUE(category) over ( partition by cnt order by rnum), brand_name from cte2
